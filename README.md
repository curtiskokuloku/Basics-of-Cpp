# Intro-to-C++

> Welcome to the C++ Introductory Course Repository! This repository contains a collection of simple C++ programs and examples designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to C++ programming concepts. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics of C++ or an experienced programmer refreshing your skills, this repository is a valuable resource.

## Getting Started

> To run these programs, you need a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can compile and execute the C++ programs using popular compilers like g++, Visual C++, or Xcode (for macOS users). Simply navigate to the repository directory and use the following command to compile the C++ program:

```pseudo
g++ filename.cpp -o filename
```

Replace 'filename.cpp' with the name of the program you want to compile. The -o filename option specifies the output executable name. Then, run the compiled executable with:

```pseudo
./filename
```

Make sure to check the output file for the expected output of each program.
